 *   data-theme="dark" -> force dark
 *
 * tokens.css maps that attribute to `color-scheme`, and every colour token
 * is declared with light-dark(), so the palette follows automatically. No
 * component, and nothing else in this file, ever needs to know which theme is
 * active or what any colour resolves to.
 *
 * Ported from the sibling system at ~/Documents/article, deliberately
 * unchanged bar the names: a person who has met one of the two systems
 * should not have to learn a second way of asking for dark.
